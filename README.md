# LIMBO STATE!!!

This code is in a weird limbo state. It doesn't have a clear intention and is confused!.

A lot of the code is commented out because I'm both trying to make a game and also trying different experiments and patterns to implement and orgaznie this half-game half-canvas drawing and animating experiments.

From this repo I should fork to a canvas-game repo, and then cleanup and merge into master or merge then cleanup, one of those.
