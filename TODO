Ideas:
  - Color themes for levels
  - One level all the balls start still, then shoot in one at high speed to set others off.
  - Different patterns of circle movement.
  - Diff circle sizes, speed, etc for levels and difficulty.
  - Character selection based on discord avatars, characters have different abilities like more speed.

TODO:
