Ideas:
  - Color themes for levels
  - One level all the balls start still, then shoot in one at high speed to set others off.
  - Different patterns of circle movement.
  - Diff circle sizes, speed, etc for levels and difficulty.
  - Character selection based on discord avatars, characters have different abilities like more speed.
  - Focus on bringing it back to game
  - Figure out how I want overall system to work
  - Branch off experiments into two games, one is the current, the other a bullet hell game
  - Make the circles bosses like uniquely and nhcarrigan
  - Gather all the keys before the guardians let you in.
  - Add another mode, instead of levels, key goal. Do survival mode.
