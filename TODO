Ideas:
  - Color themes for levels
  - One level all the balls start still, then shoot in one at high speed to set others off.
  - Diff circle sizes, speed, etc for levels and difficulty.
  - Character selection based on discord avatars, characters have different abilities like more speed.
  - Figure out how I want overall system to work
  - Branch off experiments into two games, one is the current, the other a bullet hell game
  - Make the circles bosses like uniquely and nhcarrigan
  - Gather all the keys before the guardians let you in.
  - Add another mode, instead of levels, key goal. Do survival mode.
  - Maybe a nice effect: Guardians transparent and benign when touching, else dangerous and opaque
  - Add sound effects for ball, player, and goal collisions.
  - A level where the goal moves around
  - Ability for enemy to shoot bullets
  - Ability to be/choose character
  
  TODO:
    I might switch the color system to take all hsl inputs because it is easier to
    iterate through them for the classic psychedelic effect. I'm not sure how it will
    effect the current system however. I might have to choose one way or refactor something.
    ☐ Figure out and implement color system
    
    Have to figure out how my system will be. One particle creator or more, do I make another
    set of config objects for the new particle creator? What about the particle manipulators?
    ☐ Different patterns of circle movement.
    
    ☐ Create a base class for circle and extend that into appropriate objects
